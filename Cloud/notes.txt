Hybrid MultiCloud Architecture
    Flexibility
    Allowing shifting of data and resources according to the usage
    Prevents vendor lock in and opens up options to other cloud providers as well
    Extra recommendation systems , usage of AI and ML for predictive analysis

Microservices Architecture
    Basically it focuses on breaking up a larger problem into smaller ones
    Loosely coupled , independently deployable services

    Building a large application function vise , for eg:
        One team can handle search feature
        One can handle the recommendation
        One can handle the data

    Each process can be completed by a dedicated team of developers
    Each process can have its particular stack and resources

    There is no need to create everything from scratch or build it together
    Different teams can work on their specific functions and then just
    join all the functionalities using API

    For joining they will require a Service discovery to identify each and every
    function and then each function can be transferred using Containers

    Containers provide the advantage in fault toularence and helps in keeping
    the application running , if one functionality fails then we can just 
    replace the container that is affected

    Just like on a streaming platform by joining all the functionalities , the 
    platform will not only suggest us the trending topics but also the titles
    based on our watch history

Serverless Computing
    Offloads responsibility of infrastructure , scheduling , patching and provisioning to cloud providers
    Making it easy for developers to focus on building and logic of code 
    Better suited for short running processes
    Like IOT , Serverless Microservices , 
    But on the other hand while handling workloads of a long running process
    The traditional model is preferable and more cost effective

    Problematic in the case of:
        Authentication
        Monitoring
        Configuration Management
        i.e Vendor lock-in

Cloud Native Apps
    Flexibility , Adaptive
    Specifically build for cloud platforms or existing apps are modernized accordingly

DevOps
    Process in which multiple parties like:
        Business (customers),
        Developers
        Operations
        Quality assurance
    All the teams put a collaborative approach for an efficient development

    This provides benefits in
    Continuous delivery
    Continuous integration
    Continuous development
    Continuous Monitoring
    Delivery pipeline : 
        Includes ideation , coding , building , deploying , managing , 
        Continuous improvement

    DevOps help in Cloud Computing:
        Automatic and proper installation
        Complex work because of so many independent processes and tech stack
        so DevOps define how people work together
        Continuos integration and deployment pipeline
        test in low cost and production like environments
        Recover from disasters by rebuilding system quickly 

        Provides powerful set of rules , practices and tools for modernization
        
    CLoud security:
        Considerations for each cloud service model
        -- Lack of visibility in public cloud
        -- Multitenancy in a public cloud
        -- Access Management
        -- Misconfiguration of assets

        Threats & Risks:
        -- Insider threats , from anyone with access or who used to have access
        -- DDoS attacks , denial of service by overloading the system using multiple
        syncronised system all around through Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP)
        -- Security breach

        Identity & Access Management:
        -- AI powered context to automate risk management , constantly authenticate
        -- Allow scalability
        -- Modernize at your own pace 
        -- Establish a zero-trust implementation that ensures that right users
        get the right resources at the right time under right conditions 

        Benefits of Cloud Network Security:
        -- Centralized security monitoring and management
        -- Easy management and updating of granular policies
        -- Real time detection and powerful prevention against intrusions
        -- Automated Configuration and Management
        -- Encryption services to protect data at rest and in transit
        -- Centralized monitoring and management of Identity and Access

        Best Practices for cloud Security
        1) Identify your cloud usage state and risks 
            Who has access
            Detecting unknown cloud usage
            Checking Configuration
            Monitoring for malicious usage
        2) Protect your cloud system
            Assigning protection policies
            Encrypting sensitive data
            Restricting data sharing to unknown devices
            Implementing bot protection
            Anti malware 
        3) Response to successful attacks and attepts to attacks
            Add additional authentication and verification steps
            Add new policies for new cloud services
